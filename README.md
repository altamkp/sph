# sph
Parallel C++ program for Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH)

This program simulates fluid particle interactions using the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation.

The program has been optimised and parallelised such that it can run on as many processes as assigned.

To run the program, use the makefile in a Linux environment to compile all .cpp and .h files, then run the program sph.

For detailed documentation, please refer to respective scripts. For a discussion on the implemention of the program, please refer to the report.
